# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
  - Front end is coming a long nicely.
- Are you managing your stress?
  - I am using a pomodoro timer to track my time.
- What has you most worried?
  - I ran into an issue today with the modals but I got it figured out and I should finish tomorrow.
