# Daily Reflection

Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.

## Prompts

  - I finished the project.
- Are you managing your stress?
  - I'm not feeling much stress now that I finished. Just the new stress of needing to get a job now.
