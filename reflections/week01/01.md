## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    - It creates a history of changes in your code. This is helpful in case you ever need to revert back to a previous code state.
2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
    - You can code different pieces of functionality in each branch and then decide if you actually want to keep them. Using multiple branches won't mess up your main branch if you decide to not merge your branch into main.
3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
    - Git is the actual version control where GitHub is the online platform for saving all your Git information. GitHub makes it so you don't have to just keep all your code and Git history on your local machine.
