# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
* I thought this week went really well. I am much more confident in my HTML structuring and my confidence in CSS has improved an absurd amount. Bootstrap is really interesting and I understand how it works behind the scenes which, I think, will help me while utilizing it in the future.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
* Bootstrap was definitely the biggest surprise. It was crazy how easy it made structuring a web page.
- What are you struggling with?
* I feel confident with HTML and CSS but the thing I struggle with is probably just my speed. It is hard for me to know what to prioritize while coding and often times I will go in trying to tie down the page structure and I will find myself putting in content into the page or researching some random css property.
- What would you count as a victory?
* The two pieces I am most proud of is the first bootstrap site clone and the checkpoint. Being able to take them from a blank white screen at the beginning to what they are now is super satisfying.
