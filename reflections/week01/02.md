## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
* modifies a selector based on the state of said selector. There is a hover and an active that I could see using quite a bit. The link and visited are also useful for changing a tags in html. 
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
* specificity is the order in which css is applied to html based on css's internal "importance" rules. For example, you can apply broad css to a tag (specificity of 1) and then go deeper with styling using classes (specificity of 10). Anything with the class will be styled and anything without will use the broader tag styling.
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
* There may be a point where you are expecting the styling to change with a certain css rule but it won't because of a rogue !important.
