## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
- The one that will definitely be in my thoughts constantly moving forward is using color and weight to increase or decrease the perceived importance of certain elements on the page.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
- The bootstrap docs would be good as they already have a lot of pleasing designs to pull from. Obviously, the documentation linked above will be a good resource as it gets straight to the point with a lot of good information. I would also use tools to aid in my designs such as helpers for css gradients or theme color pallette creators and the such.
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
- I know for myself that a good design is almost as important as the content in it. I recently was getting my personal training certification and had to decide between 2 different entities. I picked the one with the better looking website so I know it makes a difference in how professional you are perceived by people.
