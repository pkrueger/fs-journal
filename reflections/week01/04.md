## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
- It offers you a way to start looking at the layout of your site before you start building it. This makes it easier when you start with writing HTML and CSS because you already have an idea of what to do.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- There are low, mid and high-fidelity wireframes. Low fidelity give a very rough idea of structure. Mid give a much more realistic view of a page layout without adhering to any specific design principles. High gives very specific layouts in regards to pixels and may have color schemes chosen as well as some of the logic put in place for links and other such things.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
- Starting to write code in the dark can waste a lot of time, especially on more complex projects. It is always a good idea to have a wireframe, even if it is only a low fidelity one.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
