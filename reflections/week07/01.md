## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
    - Less maintenance costs down the road as code quality is higher. It is also a good way to train junior devs as they get pick up on things from their senior counterpart.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
    - Slightly more overhead and extra thought put in towards making an environment conducive to this style of programming.
