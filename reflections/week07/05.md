# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - I'm really understanding the code and Vue. 
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - The reading for JSDoc was interesting as I didn't know you code provide that type of documentation and intellisense help on a per function basis.
- What are you struggling with?
  - Vue file organization. It feels like it gets messy really quick
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I finished the checkpoint a day early.
