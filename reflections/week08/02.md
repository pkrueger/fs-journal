## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
    - In a small team it can sometimes feel like there is no way to meet the end goal and that could potentially make people feel the need to have more meetings and plan things out. Planning is definitely good but having to many meetings can also impact work. Having constant communication in a small team can make the task of keeping up to date on where a project lies much easier which then makes it easy to communicate that to stakeholders.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
    - Setting realistic expectations with stakeholders and improving communication between team members.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
    - Fast, Cheap, Good. Pick two.
