## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    - Unit - tests single methods or whatever you count as a "unit"
    - Component - Tests a full component with DOM elements and javascript.
    - E2E - Tests full application from a user position and takes somewhat longer than the other two.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    - Unit testing seems the most helpful because you can make sure each brick that you are building your application with is sound. If all the pieces are good then the final product has a higher chance of working properly as well.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    - Right now probably E2E just because I haven't written anything large enough to warrant it yet. I can see where it would be useful though.
