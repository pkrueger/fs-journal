# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - We got through all but one of our MVP items by Friday
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - Just the amount of organization and communication a team needs when working on the same project. We need a lot of communication and I'm sure we could do even more to be better about it.
- What are you struggling with?
  - Making sure we use the same naming and styling conventions.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I feel like I'm adding a lot to the team in the role of product owner.
