## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

   - A lot of things can be solved with exports. Naming functions, file length, easier debugging etc.

2. How does export differ from export default?

   - Export const is a named export and you have to give export default a name and can only have one default export per file.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
   - It organizes your code efficiently and privatizes your code so users only have access to what they need to have access to.
