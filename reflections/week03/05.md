# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - I feel like I retained a lot of the information that was given to us.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - The MVC pattern was a shock in general. It makes sense thinking about it but it definitely seemed too complicated for its own good when it was first presented to us.
- What are you struggling with?
  - Some organizational issues and just trying to figure out how to call functions between files.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - The checkpoint was not as hard as I thought it would be for just getting the basic functionality but it was still hard with trying for some smaller details.
