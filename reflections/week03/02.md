## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

   - Only displaying needed information to end users. It also makes your code more agile as it can be changed easier.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

   - The underscore prefix relied entirely on developer and users obeying the made up rules of those being private functions. They could still be used which could be bad. Closures can function a lot like classes and create private pieces of data only accessible by methods.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
   - Create the variable with '#variable' and then use it with 'this.#variable'
