## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

   - A primary key is a unique identifier on a table to differentiate the rows. A Foreign key is how you hook tables relationships together.

2. What is an `Alias`?

   - In a SQL statement you can bring in a table using a shorter name in order to condense code. It can also rename a column to bring it in as a unique column or just in order to reference it a different way.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatient (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
p.*
FROM doctorsPatient dp
  JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
  JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
WHERE d.id = @doctorId;
```
