# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - I finally understand many to many relationships.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - How dapper looks for tables in queries. It makes a lot more sense how to use joins now.
- What are you struggling with?
  - I don't feel like I'm struggling with anything in particular right now.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I finished the backend on Friday for the final.
