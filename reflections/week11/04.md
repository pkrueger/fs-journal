## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- I have enjoyed my time here and I am amazed at what I can build today vs what I started out being able to do. I have also enjoyed meeting everyone in the cohort and it has been fun getting to know everyone. I'm sad that we'll all have to part ways but hopefully we can meet back up in the workforce.
