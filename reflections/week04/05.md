# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - I thought everything went well generally.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - I've always been very interested in how to interact with APIs and it turned out to be simpler than I had thought.
- What are you struggling with?
  - I'm still figuring out where certain things should be placed in the MVC architecture.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - Finishing my checkpoint while being sick. I wasn't able to work on it until Sunday so that gave me a shortened time frame.
