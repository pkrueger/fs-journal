> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

   - Some of the signs are when your code is looking like spaghetti code and you have nested functions. This can happen naturally while writing as it can be like your thought process.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

   - async just means it happens later so you can use that in your code when you know things are going to take a bit of time to get done before you run more code that is reliant on the first part being completed.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
   - Keep code shallow
     - Don't nest functions. Keep them separate and call inside.
   - Modularize
     - Create smaller pieces of code and then fit them together
   - Handle every single error
     - Make sure you know exactly where errors are being thrown from.
