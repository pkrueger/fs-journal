## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
    - Lifecycle hooks give you access to your vue component in different cycles of its life.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
    - Setting functions/methods to run when a component was mounted and we have already been using them by calling them in the setup() as that is the equivalent of oncreated()

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
    - beforemount will give you access to the component after everything if compiled but before it is actually displayed so you don't have access to the DOM yet.
    mounted will give you full access to the DOM and you can make any changes you need. This is the most used hook.
