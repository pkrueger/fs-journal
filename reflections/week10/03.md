## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

   - a single entry in a table has values under each column so 1 item is a row. Columns are used for the different fields that make up an item.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
)
```

3. What are the difference between the following statements:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- 1st deletes all data out of table but keeps the skeleton of the table
- 2nd deletes the table along with the contents
