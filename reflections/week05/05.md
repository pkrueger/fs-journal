# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - I really appreciated the longer lectures as I felt like I actually got a lot more understanding than previous weeks.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - Nested virtuals in a populate was my biggest surprise this week. That blew my mind.
- What are you struggling with?
  - Biggest thing with the server side that I struggle with is the assignment of the url in the super for how to access the information in the api.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I did not think I would like working the back end for the hackathon but I ended up enjoying it way more than I thought.
