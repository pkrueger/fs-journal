## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

   - setting deadlines for broken down tasks

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

   1. Setting time for tasks. I could say that I will style a page for the next hour as that will help me not spend too long doing that.
   2. Swallow the frog. I normally do the hard part last but I will try doing it first instead.
   3. Strategic quitting. Make sure what I'm doing is really worth my time and know when to quit if it isn't.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
   - I always spend a lot of time in my CSS file and would definitely benefit from setting some limits for myself on how long that took.
