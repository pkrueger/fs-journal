## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

   - You have a road map and some basic ideas of how to tackle problems which makes your code more focused. If you just jump right in to coding there are a lot of things that you could forget or make harder than it needs to be.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

   - GOOGLE IT! Google is a great resource for finding other people that had/have the same question you do. It is important to not just copy code from online sources though and to make sure that you actually understand the solutions so you can grow as a coder and a problem solver.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

   - The planning for the unknown section spoke to me the most. I am often times finding myself coding for unknown edge cases and wasting my time in that way.
