# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - I felt like everything went well this week. I'm much more confident in JavaScript and feel like I can put projects together rather quickly.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - the spread syntax was really cool and helped with my checkpoint project
- What are you struggling with?
  - My biggest struggle is still overcoding. I don't have trouble breaking the project down before I start coding but I have a hard time sticking to my plan.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I was able to finish a lot more of the afternoon projects during lab time this week.
