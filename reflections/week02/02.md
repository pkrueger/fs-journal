## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

   1. Function declaration - function name() {} this way the function is hoisted and can be called before declaration.
   2. Function expression - let someVariable = function() {} can be anonymous or named and is saved in a variable. Not hoisted.
   3. Arrow function - let someVariable = (parameters) => {} shorter way to write an anonymous function. Also not hoisted.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

   - Parameters are the variables used when writing a function to explain how to use the arguments that will eventually be passed in when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
   - Higher order functions are a function that is used as a parameter or when a function returns another function. An example is the Array.prototype.filter function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- The importance of writing out a plan for your code. I had some ideas I wanted to execute on and it would have been extremely hard if I had not written out some pseudo code for my logic. While I didn't end up accomplishing my goal the same exact way as what I had planned, it gave me a clear starting and ending line.
