## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
    + The area of your code where a variable lives

2. What is Hoisting ?
    + Variables get declared at the top of your code but aren't initialized for 'let' and 'const' and are initialized as undefined for 'var'

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    + If you want block scope then you need to use 'const' or 'let'. Generally we shouldn't use 'var' anymore as the other two are better.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
