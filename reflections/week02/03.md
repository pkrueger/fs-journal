## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- You can put console.log() messages in your code to get a snapshot of variable values or the like. You can also test function directly in the console to pass in different arguments and check what is returned. It is also where error messages are displayed which will have links to the relevant tabs in the dev tools to look into the error further.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The Elements tab. This is super useful because you can actually change html and css and see the changes on the page live.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- creating breakpoints in your code so you can step through your code in the sources panel.
