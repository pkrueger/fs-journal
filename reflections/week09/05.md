# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?

  - socket was easier to implement than I thought once we learned how to do it.
- What are you struggling with?
  - conflicting CSS ideas that we didn't iron out until the very end.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - Our website does exactly what we want it to.
