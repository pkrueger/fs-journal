   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

 }
```

**8.** In what tag does the majority of your code belong?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```html
<body></body>
```

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```html

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Makes whatever html tag you put it on take up 100% of the width it is allowed and makes it so its direct child tags are flex items. The flex items are displayed in a row by default but the flexbox can now have many more properties attributed to it in order to change how the flex box is structured and how the flex items arrange themselves.
```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
1. The content itself (things like font-size etc. can change this)
2. The padding to the edge of the element (distance from content to edge of content box)
3. The border around the box element
4. The margins outside the actual box (don't do anything to the content inside the box but it interacts with things outside the box)
5. You could also just supply a height and width for the box to affect its size
